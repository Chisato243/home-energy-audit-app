        <!-- <h2> Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Residential energy consumption is a major contributor to both utility costs and environmental impact. However, many households are unaware of inefficiencies in their homes that lead to energy waste. While professional energy audits exist, they are often costly, time-consuming, or inaccessible to the average homeowner. This project seeks to address this gap by designing a digital tool that makes home energy evaluation easier, more affordable, and more user-friendly. By guiding users through a structured, intuitive audit process, the app aims to empower individuals to make informed decisions about improving their home's energy performance.
        </p>
        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a summer research effort to build a mobile and web application that helps users perform basic home energy audits. The app is designed to guide trained individuals through a clear step-by-step process for checking a home's energy use. Users will be able to enter basic building details, follow structured checklists for areas like insulation, windows, and lighting, and upload simple utility information. The app will also support basic sketching tools and generate a final summary page with their notes and observations. The goal is to create a simple, accessible tool that can make home energy evaluations easier for users who do not have access to expensive or complicated software.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This project explores the design and development of a simple mobile and web application that helps users conduct basic home energy audits. The tool guides people through a clear process to record house features, identify possible energy waste, and suggest improvements. The final product is designed to be accessible, structured, and easy to use for both personal learning and real evaluation tasks.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Many homes consume more energy than necessary, but not everyone has access to professional energy audit services. Existing tools are often expensive, complex, or hard to use. We want to build a lightweight app that allows trained users to perform simple energy evaluations, helping them make informed decisions and reduce waste at home.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Home energy audits usually involve checking areas like insulation, air leaks, lighting, and appliance efficiency. Utility data is also analyzed to see how energy is being used. Auditors often use specialized tools, but there is a need for more accessible solutions. This project looks into how such a process can be supported digitally, especially for students or individuals who want to learn and take action themselves.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a step-by-step app for home energy evaluation using Flutter</li>
            <li>Include sections for home info, audit checklist, utility data, sketches, and notes</li>
            <li>Generate a summary report based on user input</li>
            <li>Support use on both mobile and desktop browsers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>System Design Overview</h2>
        <p>The app is divided into several screens: a welcome page, home information input, category-based audit checklists, an optional sketch tool, and a summary report screen. All data is stored locally at first. The interface is clean and responsive, with dark mode by default. The system is developed in Flutter and deployed using GitHub Pages for web compatibility.</p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>May:</strong> Research and design planning, UI sketches, environment setup</li>
            <li><strong>June:</strong> Core module development: home info, checklist, and navigation</li>
            <li><strong>July:</strong> Sketch tool, report output, visual polishing</li>
            <li><strong>August:</strong> Testing, documentation, and final demo preparation</li>
        </ul>
