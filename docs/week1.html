  <h1>Week 1 Progress Report</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 05/15</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The first week of the summer research project focused on preparing for the development of a cross-platform home energy audit app. The main tasks included reviewing audit procedures, exploring common features in existing tools, setting up the development environment, and beginning basic interface construction using Flutter.</p>

  <h2>Objectives Achieved</h2>
  <p>This week, the structure and goals of a typical home energy audit were reviewed. Public documentation and tutorials from similar tools were used as references to understand what functions are commonly included. Based on this, the app was planned to include several core modules: a welcome screen, a home information input form, a checklist section, a utility input section, an optional sketch tool, and a summary report page.</p>

  <p>The Flutter development environment was successfully installed and verified on a Windows 11 system. A new project was created, and test runs on Chrome confirmed that the setup was working correctly with hot reload and routing enabled.</p>

  <p>The first screen, the Welcome Page, was designed and implemented. It includes the app title, a short description, and a button to begin the audit. Navigation was set up using named routes, and the screen layout was tested and confirmed to be functional in the browser.</p>

  <h2>Screen Planning</h2>
  <p>The layout and function of the main app screens were also planned this week. The following pages were outlined:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Welcome Page:</strong> Introduction and entry point to start the audit</li>
    <li><strong>Home Info Page:</strong> Form for year built, area, floors, home type, and postal code</li>
    <li><strong>Checklist Page:</strong> Audit items grouped by category (e.g., insulation, lighting, windows)</li>
    <li><strong>Utility Entry Page:</strong> Input for monthly utility usage</li>
    <li><strong>Sketch Tool Page:</strong> Optional drawing tool for layout notes</li>
    <li><strong>Summary Page:</strong> Overview of inputs and observations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>The next step is to implement the Home Info Page. This will include form elements such as dropdowns and text fields for collecting house details. A basic data model will be added to store input, and navigation will be expanded to connect this page with the Welcome Page. The goal is to complete and test the form next week before continuing to the checklist module.</p>
