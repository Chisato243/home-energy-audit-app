This week marks the start of my summer research project. The focus of this stage has been to better understand the home energy audit process and lay the foundation for the app’s development. I began by reviewing existing audit standards and procedures, including basic elements such as insulation inspection, HVAC system evaluation, and appliance energy usage. I also studied the SnuggPro platform and similar commercial tools to identify essential features commonly used in the field, such as step-by-step audit checklists, data entry tools, and visual report generation.

Based on this research, I created a preliminary list of core features for the app and started outlining the user flow. I drafted several wireframe sketches to explore how users will move through the audit process in the app. In addition, I set up the development environment for Flutter and initialized the basic project structure, which includes screen navigation and folder organization for future modules.

The goal for next week is to begin implementing the user login and home information input screens, while continuing to refine the user flow and feature list based on what I’ve learned so far. Overall, this week laid a strong foundation for development, and I now have a clearer picture of how the app will function.
